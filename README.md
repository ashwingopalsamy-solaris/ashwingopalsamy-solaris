Howdy! I'm **Ashwin Gopalsamy.** I engineer the **Core-Banking** systems at **Solaris SE**.<br>

This is my alter-ego - a private account designed to be the playground for only my Solaris dev-tools.

In-case if you've slipped down here by mistake, I'd suggest you to visit [@ashwingopalsamy](https://www.github.com/ashwingopalsamy) & [ashwingopalsamy.in](https://ashwingopalsamy.in) for more info.
